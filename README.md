# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
I will be using Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. I will be:
  - Creating a branch from the master branch on GitHub.
  - Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
  - Merge a branch with the master branch on GitHub.
  - Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
  - Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
  - Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
  - Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
  - Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
  - Render maps on a local server.

## Resources
- Data Source: logic.js, index.html, GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json
- Software: HTML, VS Code, JavaScript, Plotly.js, API, GeoJSON, Leaflet.js

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, to illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates, I'll need to log in to GitHub and access the tectonic plate data from the provided repository. I'll need to achieve the goals below.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
  2. Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
  3. Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
  4. Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.

## Challenge Submission
Please check file "logic.js" "style.css" and "index.html" in the repository for code.
